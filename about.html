        <h1>About The Project</h1>
            <p>This project was born from a simple observation: creating a dynamic, easy-to-use family tree online wasn't as straightforward as it should be. </p>
            <p>I embarked on this journey to develop my own coding and product management skills by building a solution from the ground up. </p>
            <p>The goal was to create a tool that is not only functional but also beautiful and intuitive. It's designed to be a personal space for families to map out their history, preserve their lineage for future generations, and understand the rich tapestry of connections that defines them.</p>
            <p>This application is a step towards making family history more accessible and engaging for everyone.</p>
